# Dice Wars â€” Multiplayer (React + Node)

A playful, open-source take on Dice Wars. This repo contains a React front-end (Vite) and a Node/Express + Socket.IO server. It's designed for easy deployment on Render/Fly/Railway and for tinkering.

## Quickstart
1. npm install
2. npm start

The start script will build the client and start the server. Visit http://localhost:3000

## How to help
- Improve UI, add animations, make the map bigger
- Add authentication, persistent rooms, rankings
- Improve game AI or add bots
